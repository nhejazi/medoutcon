Description: Estimators of a parameter formulated to compare two user-given
    values of a treatment variable A on an outcome variable Y, allowing for the
    effect of the treatment on the outcome, through a direct path (i.e., through
    A only) as well as an indirect path through a set of mediators M, to be
    evaluated in the presence of a binary mediator-outcome confounder Z. The
    approach imposes a static intervention on the treatment and a stochastic
    intervention on the mediators M, thus deriving stochastic (in)direct effects
    in the presence of mediator-outcome confounding. Currently supported are a
    substitution (G-computation) and one-step (AIPW) estimator. Support for IPW
    and targeted minimum loss (TML) estimators are planned for future releases.
    For an in-depth treatment of the methodology, see Rudolph, Díaz, Hejazi,
    and van der Laan; 2019+ (preprint); <https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.YYYYY>.
