Description: Efficient estimators of interventional (in)direct effects in the
    presence of mediator-outcome confounding affected by exposure. The effects
    estimated allow for the impact of the exposure on the outcome through a
    direct path to be disentangled from that through mediators, even in the
    presence of intermediate confounders that complicate such a relationship.
    Currently supported are non-parametric efficient one-step and targeted
    minimum loss estimators based on the formulation of Díaz, Hejazi, Rudolph,
    and van der Laan (2020) <doi:10.1093/biomet/asaa085>. Support for efficient
    estimation of the natural (in)direct effects is also provided, appropriate
    for settings in which intermediate confounders are absent.
