Description: Efficient estimators of a interventional (in)direct effects in the
    presence of mediator-outcome confounding affected by exposure. The effects
    estimated allow for the impact of the treatment on the outcome through a
    direct path to be disentangled from that through mediators, even in the
    presence of intermediate confounders that complicate this relationship.
    Currently supported are non-parametric efficient one-step and targeted
    minimum loss (TML) estimators, based on the formulation of Díaz, Hejazi,
    Rudolph, and van der Laan (2019+) <https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.09936>.
