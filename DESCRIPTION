Description: Efficient estimators of a stochastic (in)direct effects in the
    presence of mediator-outcome confounding affected by exposure. The effects
    estimated allow for the impact of the treatment on the outcome through a
    direct path to be disentangled from that through mediators, even in the
    presence of intermediate confounders that complicate this relationship.
    Currently supported are an efficient one-step (AIPW) estimator and a
    targeted minimum loss (TML) estimator. Support for classical estimators
    (g-computation, IPW) are planned for future releases. For an in-depth
    treatment of the methodology, see Díaz, Hejazi, Rudolph, and van der Laan;
    2019+ (preprint); <https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.YYYYY>.
