# medoutcon 0.1.5

* For user clarity, the name of the argument for providing externally computed
  observation-level weights has changed (from `ext_weights`) to `svy_weights`.
* Support for the natural direct and indirect effects has been added, alongside
  a new argument `effect_type` in the `medoutcon()` function. The default is
  still the interventional direct and indirect effects.

# medoutcon 0.1.0

* An initial public release of this package, version 0.1.0, which includes
  support for external observation-level weights.
