## What's `medoutcon`?

The `medoutcon` R package provides facilities for efficient estimation of
path-specific (in)direct effects that measure the impact of a treatment variable
$A$ on an outcome variable $Y$, through a direct path (through $A$ only) and an
indirect path (through a set of mediators $M$ only). In the presence of an
intermediate <b>med</b>iator-<b>out</b>come <b>con</b>founder $Z$, itself
affected by the treatment $A$, these correspond to the _interventional_
(in)direct effects described by @diaz2020nonparametric, though similar (yet less
general) effect definitions and/or estimation strategies have appeared in
@vanderweele2014effect, @rudolph2017robust, @zheng2017longitudinal, and
@benkeser2020nonparametric. When no intermediate confounders are present, these
effect definitions simplify to the well-studied _natural_ (in)direct effects,
and our estimators are analogs of those formulated by @zheng2012targeted.  Both
an efficient one-step bias-corrected estimator with cross-fitting
[@pfanzagl1985contributions; @zheng2011cross; @chernozhukov2018double] and a
cross-validated targeted minimum loss estimator (TMLE) [@vdl2011targeted;
@zheng2011cross] are made available. `medoutcon` integrates with the [`sl3` R
package](https://github.com/tlverse/sl3) [@coyle2020sl3] to leverage statistical
machine learning in the estimation procedure.

## Example

To illustrate how `medoutcon` may be used to estimate stochastic interventional
(in)direct effects of the exposure (`A`) on the outcome (`Y`) in the presence of
mediator(s) (`M`) and a mediator-outcome confounder (`Z`), consider the
following example:

```{r example, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(data.table)
library(tidyverse)
library(medoutcon)
set.seed(1584)

# produces a simple data set based on ca causal model with mediation
make_example_data <- function(n_obs = 1000) {
  ## baseline covariates
  w_1 <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, prob = 0.6)
  w_2 <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, prob = 0.3)
  w_3 <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, prob = pmin(0.2 + (w_1 + w_2) / 3, 1))
  w <- cbind(w_1, w_2, w_3)
  w_names <- paste("W", seq_len(ncol(w)), sep = "_")

  ## exposure
  a <- as.numeric(rbinom(n_obs, 1, plogis(rowSums(w) - 2)))

  ## mediator-outcome confounder affected by treatment
  z <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, plogis(rowMeans(-log(2) + w - a) + 0.2))

  ## mediator -- could be multivariate
  m <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, plogis(rowSums(log(3) * w[, -3] + a - z)))
  m_names <- "M"

  ## outcome
  y <- rbinom(n_obs, 1, plogis(1 / (rowSums(w) - z + a + m)))

  ## construct output
  dat <- as.data.table(cbind(w = w, a = a, z = z, m = m, y = y))
  setnames(dat, c(w_names, "A", "Z", m_names, "Y"))
  return(dat)
}

# set seed and simulate example data
example_data <- make_example_data()
w_names <- str_subset(colnames(example_data), "W")
m_names <- str_subset(colnames(example_data), "M")

# quick look at the data
head(example_data)

# compute one-step estimate of the interventional direct effect
os_de <- medoutcon(W = example_data[, ..w_names],
                   A = example_data$A,
                   Z = example_data$Z,
                   M = example_data[, ..m_names],
                   Y = example_data$Y,
                   effect = "direct",
                   estimator = "onestep")
os_de

# compute targeted minimum loss estimate of the interventional direct effect
tmle_de <- medoutcon(W = example_data[, ..w_names],
                     A = example_data$A,
                     Z = example_data$Z,
                     M = example_data[, ..m_names],
                     Y = example_data$Y,
                     effect = "direct",
                     estimator = "tmle")
tmle_de
```
