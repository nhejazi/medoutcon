\title{Fit intervention-specific nuisance parameter for a binary exponential tilt}
\usage{
fit_phi_mech_ipsi(data, lrnr_stack, m_output, w_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{data.table} containing the observed data, with columns
in the order specified by the NPSEM (Y, Z, A, W), with column names set
appropriately based on the original input data. Such a structure is merely
a convenience utility to passing data around to the various core estimation
routines and is automatically generated as part of a call to the user-facing
wrapper function \code{medshift}.}

\item{lrnr_stack}{A \code{Stack} object, or other learner class (inheriting
from \code{Lrnr_base}), containing a single or set of instantiated learners
from the \code{sl3} package, to be used in fitting a cleverly parameterized
propensity score that includes the mediators, i.e., e = P(A | Z, W).}

\item{m_output}{Object containing results from fitting the outcome
regression, as produced by a call to \code{fit_m_mech}.}

\item{w_names}{A \code{character} vector of the names of the columns that
correspond to baseline covariates (W). The input for this argument is
automatically generated by a call to the wrapper function \code{medshift}.}
