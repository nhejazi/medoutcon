# Summary

Science is most often concerned with questions of _mechanism_. In myriad
applications, only the portion of the effect of an exposure variable on an
outcome variable through a particular pathway under study is of interest. The
study of such path-specific, or mediation, effects has a rich history, first
undertaken scientifically by @wright1921correlation and extended soon thereafter
in @wright1934method. Today, the study of such effects has attracted a great
deal of attention in statistics and causal inference, often inspired by
applications in disciplines from epidemiology and vaccinology to psychology and
economics. Examples include understanding the biological mechanisms by which
vaccines causally alter infection risk [@hejazi2020efficient;
@benkeser2021inference], assessing the effect of novel pharmacological therapies
on substance abuse disorder relapse [@hejazi2021nonparametric;
@rudolph2020explaining], and evaluating the effects of housing vouchers on
adolescent development [@rudolph2021helped]. The `medoutcon` `R` package
provides researchers in each of these disciplines with the tools necessary to
implement efficient estimators of the interventional (in)direct effects
[@diaz2020nonparametric], a recently formulated set of causal effects robust to
the presence of confounding of the mediator-outcome relationship by the exposure
variable. In cases where such confounding is a nonissue, the interventional
(in)direct effects [tyler, many others] reduce to the well-studied natural
(in)direct effects [@robins1992identifiability; @pearl2001direct], for which
`medoutcon` provides efficient estimators similar to those of
@zheng2012targeted. By readily incorporating the use of machine learning in the
estimation of nuisance parameters (through integration with the `sl3` `R`
package [@coyle-gh-sl3] of the `tlverse` ecosystem [@vdl2022targeted]),
`medoutcon` furnishes both researchers and analysts with access to
state-of-the-art semiparametric estimation techniques, facilitating their use in
a vast range of subject areas.

# Statement of Need

While there is demonstrable interest in causal mediation analysis in a large
variety of disciplines, thoughtfully implementing data analysis strategies based
on recent developments in this area is challenging. Developments in the causal
inference and statistics literature often fall into two key areas. Broadly, the
study of identification outlines novel causal effect parameters with properties
desirable in real-world settings (e.g., the interventional effects, which can be
learned under mediator-outcome confounding) and untestable assumptions under
which a statistical functionals corresponds to a given causal effect. Another
line of study develops semiparametric efficiency theory for the statistical
functionals matching these novel causal estimands, allowing their robust
estimation with tools from machine learning. While these complementary efforts
are necessary, neither is concerned with opening the door to applying these
estimators in real-world data analyses. What's more, the implementation of
open source software for efficient estimators of causal effects is no easy feat
-- for such a task, the data scientist must be knowledgeable of causal
inference, semiparametric theory, machine learning, and the intersection of
these disciplines (not to mention research software engineering best practices,
including, for example, unit/regression testing and continuous integration).
With these issues in mind, the `medoutcon` `R` package is a free, open source
implementation of non/semi-parametric efficient estimators of the natural and
interventional (in)direct effects, providing data scientists in research and in
industry with access to state-of-the-art statistical methodology for causal
mediation analysis.

# Causal Mediation Effects: From the Natural to the Interventional

To evaluate the causal effects of exposures on an outcome variable through
mediating pathways, let's consider a dataset of $n$ units, where the observed
data on a single unit is assumed to have been generated by a nonparametric
structural equation model (NPSEM) of the form:
\begin{align*}
  W &= f_W(U_W); A = f_A(W, U_A); Z=f_Z(W, A, U_Z);\\ \nonumber
  M &= f_M(W, A, Z, U_M); Y = f_Y(W, A, Z, M, U_Y),
\end{align*}
where $W$ are baseline (pre-exposure) covariates, $A \in \{0,1\}$ is the
(binary) exposure of interest, $Z$ is an intermediate confounder affected by
exposure $A$, $M$ represents mediating variables, and $Y$ is the outcome. This
NPSEM admits an equivalent representation as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), in
which each variable is a node and dependencies are represented by directed paths
between nodes. The natural (in)direct effects cannot be identified (i.e.,
learned from the observed data) in the presence of intermediate confounding, so,
for now, we make the simplifying assumption that the intermediate variable $Z$
does not exist. In this simple case, the population average treatment effect
(ATE) -- that is, the total effect of $A$ on $Y$, comparing two exposure
contrasts $\{a', a^{\star}\}$ -- may be decomposed into the natural direct
effect (NDE) and the natural indirect effect (NIE) as
\begin{equation*}
  \mathbb{E}[Y(a') - Y(a^{\star})] =
    \underbrace{\mathbb{E}[Y(a', M(a')) - Y(a',
      M(a^{\star}))]}_{\text{Indirect effect (through $M$)}} +
    \underbrace{\mathbb{E}[Y(a', M(a^{\star})) - Y(a^{\star},
      M(a^{\star}))]}_{\text{Direct effect (not through $M$)}},
\end{equation*}
where the NIE captures the effect of the exposure $A$ on $Y$ through the
mediating variables $M$ while the NDE captures the effect of $A$ on $Y$ through
all other pathways. @robins1992identifiability and @pearl2001direct
independently studied this decomposition within the potential outcomes and NPSEM
frameworks, respectively. In both cases, the NDE and NIE are derived from the
ATE by introducing a decomposition term that deterministically sets the values
of the exposure and mediators to differing values by the application of _static_
interventions. As regards estimation, @tchetgen2012semiparametric and
@zheng2012targeted outlined non/semi-parametric efficiency theory for developing
estimators of the NDE and NIE and proposed efficient estimators of these causal
quantities.

Recognizing the limitations of these effects, particularly in real-world data
analysis settings in which intermediate confounders abound, @didelez2006direct,
@vanderweele2014effect, and @rudolph2017robust, among others, contributed to the
development of the interventional (in)direct effects. Unlike the decomposition
strategy that delineates the NDE and NIE, a more sophisticated approach to
identification -- relying upon _stochastic_ interventions on the mediator(s) --
is required. Specifically, for the two exposure contrasts $\{a', a^{\star}\}$,
the effect of $A$ on $Y$ can be defined as the difference in expected outcome in
the hypothetical worlds in which $(A,M) = (a', G_{a'})$ versus $(A,M)
= (a^{\star}, G_{a^{\star}})$ with probability one, where Let $G_a$ denote
a random draw from the conditional distribution of $M_a$ conditional on $W$
(defined by a stochastic intervention). The total effect can then be decomposed
into direct and indirect effects as follows
\begin{equation*}
\mathbb{E}_c(Y_{a', G_{a'}} - Y_{a^{\star}, G_{a^{\star}}}) =
  \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_c(Y_{a', G_{a'}} - Y_{a',
    G_{a^{\star}}})}_{\text{Indirect effect (through $M$)}} +
  \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_c(Y_{a', G_{a^{\star}}} - Y_{a^{\star},
      G_{a^{\star}}})}_{\text{Direct effect (not through $M$)}}.
\end{equation*}
Like the NDE, this interventional direct effect measures the effects through all
paths avoiding the mediating variables. Analogous to the NIE, the interventional
indirect effect measures the effect through paths involving the mediators. Note,
however, that natural and interventional mediation effects have different
interpretations. That is, the interventional indirect effect measures the effect
of fixing the exposure at $a'$ while setting the mediator to a random draw
$G_{a^{\star}}$ from those with exposure $a'$ versus a random draw $G_{a'}$ from
those with exposure $a^{\star}$, given covariates $W$. Intuitively, the
interventional effects remain identifiable under intermediate confounding since
the stochastic intervention on the mediators breaks the relationship between $Z$
and $M$. Prior to the work of @diaz2020nonparametric, and contemporaneous
developments by @benkeser2020nonparametric, non/semi-parametric efficiency
theory for the interventional (in)direct effects was unavailable. Since then,
a novel family of interventional effects, which accommodate flexible stochastic
interventions on the exposure, have been formulated [@hejazi2021nonparametric].

# `medoutcon`'s Scope

Development of the `medoutcon` package began as a software accompaniment to the
theoretical developments of @diaz2020nonparametric -- where the investigations
of these authors outlined efficient estimators of the interventional (in)direct
effects, `medoutcon` implements these efficient estimators in the `R` language
and environment for statistical computing [@R], aiming for ease of use in data
analysis applications. Specifically, `medoutcon` -- via a single, user-facing
eponymous function `medoutcon()` -- provides access to both one-step and
targeted minimum loss (TML) estimators of these causal (in)direct effects.
Through a design that that tightly couples `medoutcon` with the `sl3` `R`
package [@coyle-gh-sl3], state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, including
ensemble modeling [@vdl2007super], can be readily used for the estimation of
relevant nuisance parameters. Via the `origami` `R` package [@coyle2018origami;
@coyle-cran-origami], cross-fitting is automatically incorporated in computing
the efficient estimators, allowing for some common but restrictive regularity
conditions to be relaxed [bickel1993efficient; @zheng2011cross;
@chernozhukov2017double].

Beyond implementing the interventional effects, `medoutcon` additionally allows
for analogs of the natural (in)direct effects to be estimated when intermediate
confounders are omitted from the call to the `medoutcon()` function (i.e., by
setting `Z = NULL`). This feature is based on a correspondence between the
identifying statistical functionals of the natural and interventional (in)direct
effects in the absence of intermediate confounding. In this simplified case, the
efficient estimators of the interventional (in)direct effects formulated by
@diaz2020nonparametric are analogous to the efficient estimators of the natural
(in)direct effects formulated by @zheng2012targeted. By supporting this case,
`medoutcon` serves as a one-stop tool for estimating these classical and popular
causal mediation effects, allowing for practicing data scientists and applied
statisticians to deploy cutting-edge estimators of the natural and
interventional (in)direct effects through a unified application user interface.

# Availability

The `medoutcon` package has been made publicly available [via
GitHub](https://github.com/nhejazi/medoutcon), with plans for submission to the
Comprehensive `R` Archive Network, pending the inclusion of its dependencies
(`sl3`, in particular) in that repository. Use of the `medoutcon` package has
been extensively documented in the package's `README`, a vignette, and its
[`pkgdown` documentation website](https://code.nimahejazi.org/medoutcon).
Ongoing development of the package incorporates research and data science
software engineering best practices, including a thorough suite of unit tests
and automated testing and code coverage checks via continuous integration
services.
