Description: Efficient estimators of a stochastic (in)direct effects in the
    presence of mediator-outcome confounding affected by exposure. The effects
    estimated allow for the impact of the treatment on the outcome through a
    direct path to be disentangled from that through mediators, even in the
    presence of intermediate confounders that complicate this relationship.
    Currently supported are an efficient one-step estimator and a targeted
    minimum loss (TML) estimator. This is a simplified implementation of the
    same techniques that appear in the medoutcon package. For an in-depth
    treatment of the methodology, see Díaz, Hejazi, Rudolph, and van der Laan;
    2019+ (preprint); <https://arxiv.org/abs/XXXX.YYYYY>.
